    Q1. Write a function which generates an integer from a given range without using the random library
    <br><br>
    Q2. You are given an m x n integer matrix with the following two properties: Each row is sorted in non-decreasing
    order. The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row. Given an integer target,
    return true if the target is in matrix or false otherwise. You must write a solution in O(log(m * n)) time
    complexity.
    <br><br>
    Q3. A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping: 'A' -> "1" 'B' ->
    "2" ... 'Z' -> "26" To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using
    the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, "11106" can be mapped into: "AAJF" with
    the grouping (1 1 10 6) "KJF" with the grouping (11 10 6) Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because "06"
    cannot be mapped into 'F' since "6" is different from "06". Given a string s containing only digits, return the
    number of ways to decode it.
    <br><br>
    Q4. Implement a function to find the second-largest element in an array of integers. Time complexity (O(log n))
    <br><br>
    Q5. Given an array of integers, find the two elements that sum up to a given target value. Time complexity (O(log
    n))
    <br><br>
    Q6. Print Dudeney Numbers between 1 and 6000
    NOTE: Dudeney Numbers are numbers whose sum of digits is equal to their cube root. root(512) = 8 and 5+1+2=8
    A: 512, 4913, 5832
    <br><br>
    Q7. Given an array of 9 elements as input [values: 0, 1, 2 (0:" ", 1:"X", 2:"O")], convert the integers to their
    corresponding strings and print them in the form of a 3x3 grid
    <br><br>
    Q8. Given a word as input, determine if it is hard to pronounce, a word is considered hard to pronounce if it has 4
    or
    more consonants in a row.
    <br><br>
    Q9. Raju is a software developer, so he has to switch between different languages sometimes. Each programming
    language
    has some features, which are represented by integers here. Currently, Raju has to use a language with two given
    features A and B. He has two options --- switching to a language with two features A1 and B1, or to a language with
    two features A2 and B2. All four features of these two languages are pairwise distinct. Tell Raju whether he can use
    the first language, the second language or neither of these languages (if no single language has all the required
    features).
    Input:
    1. First and only line contains a list of 6 integers. First 2 elements give the required features, the next two give
    the features of the first language, and the next two give the features of the second language.
    Output:
    print 0 if cannot switch
    print 1 if switch to first language
    print 2 if switch to second language

    Q10. Chandan wants to write a function that raises some number to some power, but he does not know about the pow()
    function and the ** operator. Help Chandan achieve his goal.
